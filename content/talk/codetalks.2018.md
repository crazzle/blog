title = "Production ready Data-Science with Python and Luigi"
abstract = "The rapidly growing size of data has broadened the role of data scientists. Instead of creating models for one-off analysis, it's becoming common to use prototypes in real-world applications. Spotify Luigi helps to enable such scenarios, without having to learn a whole bunch of new technologies. We will explore Luigi's concepts and learn how to code solutions for common problems in data pipelines."
