abstract = "Datacentric applications utilising machine learning models have evolved into common solutions. Many projects however still suffer from a lack of good patterns and practices, when developing such powerful technologies.
Digging down into the nitty-gritty details, we explain how you can use DVC to version all parts of your projects: From the dataset, over gluecode up to the model itself. But wait, thereâ€™s more! We show you code that covers the full development cycle, including experiments and reproducability, as well as release and deployment of your model to machines in the wild."
